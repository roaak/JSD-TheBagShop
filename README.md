### Introduction

This is a project for the Javascript Development part-time course  at General Assembly , its main gaol to display my learnings in Javascript  through actual website that contain: HTML pages,  CSS style sheets and also JavaScript files.

### About the Bag Shop

I decided to go for an e-commerce sample website since I am a UX/UI front end developer  I am familiar to creating webpages and styling them from scratch.  The website is a store selling bags as its product  _(all the product photos are samples not real products)_ so I have include a page for displaying products
as a catalogue and also a page to order a product.
the wireframe section displays the main pages in the website in a good way.

### Used Techniques:

#### jQuery

A JavaScript library that contain a shortcuts of javascript methods ,Ajax, HTML document traversal ,manipulation, event handling and animation.
the only thing is that you need to add this line in your HTML pages before `</body>` tag:

` <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js"></script> `
#### BootStrap 4

bootStrap is a CSS library that offers a ready styled classes that will save time and effort during styling and structuring HTML pages.
you can simply link it to your HTML using the following line in the `<head>` tag of your HTML document:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css">`
